# Cat-Dog_Classifier
This is a full-stack web-based image classifier that can identify if an uploaded image contains a cat or a dog. It leverages a Python Flask backend for the machine learning model inference (powered by TensorFlow/Keras and MobileNetV2), and a simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend for the user interface.
